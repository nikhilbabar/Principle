SOLID principles

S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle): A class should take care of only one responsibility.

O stands for OCP (Open closed principle): Extension should be preferred over modification.

L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle): A parent class object should be able to refer child objects seamlessly during runtime polymorphism.

I stands for ISP (Interface segregation principle): Client should not be forced to use a interface if it does not need it.

D stands for DIP (Dependency inversion principle): High level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstraction.
